# Test-Driven Development

## Stack Activation Gate

Identify the active stack from the session-start hook output. State it explicitly: "Active stack: {name}".
If not injected, use the detection signals in CLAUDE.md → Stack System.

**Required before any code output — do not skip:**
1. Read `.claude/.avila-tek-root` → this file contains `{PACK_ROOT}`, the absolute path to the plugin.
2. The active STACK.md is already in your context (injected by the session hook). Find it and locate the "Required Reading by Task Type" section → row: **Testing**.
3. For each file listed in that row, Read `{PACK_ROOT}/stacks/{active-stack}/agent_docs/{file}`. Do not proceed until those Reads are complete.

Apply the Key Patterns and run the Verification Checklist before completing any output.

> Follow the Testing Conventions from the active STACK.md (test location, mock strategy, coverage gate, test framework).

## Overview

Write a failing test before writing the code that makes it pass. For bug fixes, reproduce the bug with a test before attempting a fix. Tests are proof — "seems right" is not done. A codebase with good tests is an AI agent's superpower; a codebase without tests is a liability.

## When to Use

- Implementing any new logic or behavior
- Fixing any bug (the Prove-It Pattern)
- Modifying existing functionality
- Adding edge case handling
- Any change that could break existing behavior

**When NOT to use:** Pure configuration changes, documentation updates, or static content changes that have no behavioral impact.

**Related:** For browser-based changes, combine TDD with runtime verification using Chrome DevTools MCP — see `references/testing-patterns.md` → Browser Testing with DevTools.

## The TDD Cycle

```
    RED                GREEN              REFACTOR
 Write a test    Write minimal code    Clean up the
 that fails  ──→  to make it pass  ──→  implementation  ──→  (repeat)
      │                  │                    │
      ▼                  ▼                    ▼
   Test FAILS        Test PASSES         Tests still PASS
```

### Step 1: RED — Write a Failing Test

Write the test first. It must fail. A test that passes immediately proves nothing.

```typescript
// RED: This test fails because createTask doesn't exist yet
describe('TaskService', () => {
  it('creates a task with title and default status', async () => {
    const task = await taskService.createTask({ title: 'Buy groceries' });

    expect(task.id).toBeDefined();
    expect(task.title).toBe('Buy groceries');
    expect(task.status).toBe('pending');
    expect(task.createdAt).toBeInstanceOf(Date);
  });
});
```

### Step 2: GREEN — Make It Pass

Write the minimum code to make the test pass. Don't over-engineer:

```typescript
// GREEN: Minimal implementation
export async function createTask(input: { title: string }): Promise<Task> {
  const task = {
    id: generateId(),
    title: input.title,
    status: 'pending' as const,
    createdAt: new Date(),
  };
  await db.tasks.insert(task);
  return task;
}
```

### Step 3: REFACTOR — Clean Up

With tests green, improve the code without changing behavior:

- Extract shared logic
- Improve naming
- Remove duplication
- Optimize if necessary

Run tests after every refactor step to confirm nothing broke.

## The Prove-It Pattern (Bug Fixes)

When a bug is reported, **do not start by trying to fix it.** Start by writing a test that reproduces it.

```
Bug report arrives
       │
       ▼
  Write a test that demonstrates the bug
       │
       ▼
  Test FAILS (confirming the bug exists)
       │
       ▼
  Implement the fix
       │
       ▼
  Test PASSES (proving the fix works)
       │
       ▼
  Run full test suite (no regressions)
```

**Example:**

```typescript
// Bug: "Completing a task doesn't update the completedAt timestamp"

// Step 1: Write the reproduction test (it should FAIL)
it('sets completedAt when task is completed', async () => {
  const task = await taskService.createTask({ title: 'Test' });
  const completed = await taskService.completeTask(task.id);

  expect(completed.status).toBe('completed');
  expect(completed.completedAt).toBeInstanceOf(Date);  // This fails → bug confirmed
});

// Step 2: Fix the bug
export async function completeTask(id: string): Promise<Task> {
  return db.tasks.update(id, {
    status: 'completed',
    completedAt: new Date(),  // This was missing
  });
}

// Step 3: Test passes → bug fixed, regression guarded
```

## Red Flags

- Writing code without any corresponding tests
- Tests that pass on the first run (they may not be testing what you think)
- "All tests pass" but no tests were actually run
- Bug fixes without reproduction tests
- Tests that test framework behavior instead of application behavior
- Test names that don't describe the expected behavior
- Skipping tests to make the suite pass

## Verification

After completing any implementation:

- [ ] Every new behavior has a corresponding test
- [ ] All tests pass: `npm test`
- [ ] Bug fixes include a reproduction test that failed before the fix
- [ ] Test names describe the behavior being verified
- [ ] No tests were skipped or disabled
- [ ] Coverage hasn't decreased (if tracked)

## Output Artifact

Test files co-located with source per active stack convention:
- NestJS: `*.spec.ts` next to the file under test
- Next.js: `*.test.tsx` next to the component

Coverage report generated at project root after running the test command.
